## 🧠 About the Project

CoinHunter is an early experimental game development project aiming to explore 3D game design fundamentals.  
All game elements — including scripts, menu systems, player controls, objects, and animations — were built from scratch, while 3D assets were created in Blender.

The objective is simple yet engaging: **collect all the coins scattered around the environment** while navigating through obstacles and items.
